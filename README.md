# memeIndexer
A python program with GUI for indexing memes. If you don't care about the code, you can just run 'App/meme wallet.exe'.

New memes are to be added inside the 'web folder'. Only images of type .jpg, .jpeg and .png are detected.

BIG BUG:

The 'meme wallet.exe' fails to close properly, so it still runs in the background. This causes a 'fatal error' on any subsequent running, but all features work anyway :)
